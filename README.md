**BugHunterSuite** is a powerful website security testing suite designed to detect vulnerabilities in web applications. It helps identify critical security flaws such as Broken Access Control, Injection Attacks, Authentication Failures, and more. 

## Features

BugHunterSuite can test websites for the following vulnerabilities:

- **Broken Access Control**: Detects unauthorized access and privilege escalation issues.
- **Cryptographic Failures**: Identifies weak encryption and improper cryptographic implementations.
- **Injection Attacks**: Detects SQL injection, command injection, and other injection flaws.
- **Insecure Design**: Analyzes application logic flaws and weak design patterns.
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Finds improper security settings and default configurations.
- **Vulnerable Components**: Checks for outdated and vulnerable libraries, frameworks, and dependencies.
- **Authentication Failures**: Identifies weak authentication mechanisms and brute-force vulnerabilities.
- **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Detects tampering risks and improper validation of data integrity.
- **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Flags inadequate logging and monitoring systems.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Detects SSRF vulnerabilities that could lead to data exposure.
